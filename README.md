# http24

Ellen's own WSGI HTTP server. Functionality written in one day, with some minor touch-ups after the fact.

#### main.py | The WSGI HTTP server.
#### test.py | A flask WSGI application.
#### run.sh / run.bat | Shell scripts to run the HTTP server hosting the flask application.
#### scraps/old.py | An HTTP server I was working on before I understood WSGI. Implments GET and HEAD requests.
